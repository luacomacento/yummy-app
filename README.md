## About:
<p>A full-featured front-end application with focus on mobile design.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a recipes app, where users could simulate a login (the application has no backend, however) and search for meals or cocktails recipes, with filters for ingredients, name, nationality, etc. The user can also mark a recipe as done and save them as favorites, so they can go back at any time!</p>
<p>The app has a dark-mode available, that gets stored as an user preference to localStorage.</p>
<p>It was made to work well on mobile, so a desktop view is not advised at the moment.</p>
<p>The app was developed with <b>React.js</b> functional components, using native and custom hooks, and with <b>Redux</b> for state managing.</p>
